The KYPO platform is also used to create cybersecurity exercises and trainings. When working with the trainings, it is required to familiarize yourself with the following terms: 

* **[Training Definition](#training-definition)**
* **[Training Instance](#training-instance)**
* **[Training Run](#training-run)**

## Training Definition

The content of the whole exercise is described using so-called training definitions. They includes information about the title, notes for instructors, learning outcomes, and levels that consist of. There are three types of levels: 
   
1. **Info Level**: Contains information for the player (welcome message or important information about the following levels).
2. **Game Level**: In the level, the user has to solve a predefined assignment. By solving the assignment, the player acquires a secret flag, and after submitting the flag, they can continue to the next level of the training. 
3. **Assessment Level**: Can be either a test or a questionnaire, and it serves to test usersâ€™ knowledge or gets feedback from users. The assessment can contain one of the following types of question: 
    * *MCQ (Multiple choice question)*: Players are asked to select one or multiple answers from the choices offered as a list.
    * *EMI (Extended matching items)*: Players are asked to pair items from row and column that are semantically related. 
    * *FFQ (Freeform question)*: Players are asked to type the answer to the submit field.

## Training Instance

 A time-limited period in which players can participate in training which is specified by the assigned training definition. The whole progress of training instance is managed by  instructors who can monitor events made by players that are displayed in various graphs and tables. Each training instance has an assigned [pool](/operator-guide/sandboxes/sandboxes-overview#pool) with sandboxes. 

## Training Run
 Represents a single run of the training of the particular player. The run is accessed based on the access token obtained from the training instance instructor. The player enters the access token to the particular field and if the token is valid, the training run starts (behind the scenes, a sandbox is assigned to that training run from the pool that is associated with the particular training instance).
