# KYPO Operation Guide

The objective of the **Operation Guide** is to provide a detailed description of the KYPO CRP areas to the users who are supposed to have a better knowledge of how the platform works. The section is divided into four parts: 

1. **[Sandboxes:](../sandboxes/sandboxes-overview)** Detailed description of sandbox structure, how it works internally, or the way how to connect to the sandbox using SSH. 
2. **[Trainings:](../trainings/trainings-overview)** Detailed description of the trainings, how the training entities are interconnected, and the way how they are interconnected with sandboxes. 
3. **[Users and Groups:](../users-and-groups/users-and-groups-overview)** The section describes the permission system that is used in KYPO CRP and the meaning of the user rights.
