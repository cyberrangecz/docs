The result of the project KYPO CRP is the platform which focuses on three use cases:

1. **Emulated Virtual Environment**: Creating and providing an environment to simulate computer infrastructures in a controlled cloud environment to achieve high flexibility, scalability, isolation, and portability. The platform allows you to create fully-functional virtual networks with a full-fledged operating system and network devices that faithfully emulate real-world systems.
2. **Trainings**: Verifying and acquiring individuals' knowledge through learning activities such as training in the form of Capture the flag (CTF) games complemented by assessments of participants. KYPO CRP provides the ability to create computer cybersecurity scenarios that can be simulated on different types of operating systems in the same environment through virtualization and emulation without any impact on the real infrastructure.
3. **User Management**: Ability to manage users who want to access the KYPO platform. KYPO CRP provides a simple permission system, which is important to restrict access to the different areas of the platform through the roles of the users. It is an essential part of the platform in order to ensure the functionality of the both above-mentioned use cases.
