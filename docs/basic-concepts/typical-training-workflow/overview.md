Before starting a training run, several steps must be performed. These steps are not necessarily performed by a single user and they are usually divided among several users with a role [instructor](../../user-guide-advanced/users-and-groups/roles.md#instructor). In general, workflow is divided into two parts, as it also includes the creation of the sandboxes.

1. [Sandboxes Creation](training-workflow-cloud.md#sandboxes-creation)
2. [Training Creation](training-workflow-cloud.md#training-creation)

Several steps of both approaches overlap. Above all, the creation of training and sandbox definitions are the same. It allows instructors to reuse them for both use cases.

## Prerequisites
It is assumed that CyberRangeCZ Platform is installed according to the [installation guide](../../installation-guide/installation-guide-overview.md) and created CyberRangeCZ Platform instance is connected to the OpenStack cloud service, and through the respective microservice, it can create and manage sandboxes inside the cloud via available APIs.
