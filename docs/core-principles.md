KYPO is a unique project that serves as a training center for cybersecurity, which deals with research, development, and creation of an environment for the pre-analysis of attacks on critical information infrastructures. In this environment, it is possible to implement comprehensive security training and exercises. The result of the project is a KYPO platform used to simulate computer infrastructures in a controlled cloud environment to achieve high flexibility, scalability, isolation, and portability. The platform allows you to create fully-functional virtual networks with a full-fledged operating system and network devices that faithfully emulate real-world systems. In the environment, cybersecurity attacks can be tested repeatedly without any impact on the real infrastructure. It thus provides the opportunity to create and try out various cybersecurity scenarios reminiscent of real-world situations that take place independently of the Internet connection.


## Use cases
KYPO focuses on three use cases:

  1. **Education and Training**: Verifying and acquiring individuals' knowledge through learning activities such as training, Capture the flag (CTF) games or school subjects. KYPO provides the ability to create computer security scenarios that can be simulated on different types of operating systems in the same environment through virtualization. 
  2. **Cyber Research and Development**: Developing, testing, and demonstrating new methods for detecting and mitigating network attacks on critical infrastructure. In this case, KYPO provides an empty virtual environment with the possibility of monitoring infrastructure. Users can create various computer networks and monitor their network traffic. Statistics from this data are subsequently stored and analyzed within the KYPO infrastructure.
  3. **Digital Forensic Analysis**: It partly builds on the previous use case and covers basic forensic analysis, which is partially automated. An image with a malicious machine is placed in the virtual environment, the activities of which are then monitored using a set of automatic and dynamic analyzes. Thanks to the virtual environment, it is possible to dynamically change the environment according to the activities of the machine and monitor its behavior.


## Terminology

Before starting with the KYPO platform, you should familiarize yourself with the basic terminology that is used in it. As mentioned before, the KYPO platform is primarily used to provide virtual environment and create cybersecurity exercises and trainings. For trainings there is also need to have a virtual environment and description of their content.

### Virtual environment 
A virtual environment so-called sandbox is an isolated testing environment that enables users to run programs or execute files without affecting the application, system, or platform on which they run. In the context of KYPO, a sandbox is the virtual network infrastructure created using the OpenStack cloud service that consists of virtual machines and virtual networks. The following terminology is used when working with sandboxes:

* **Sandbox Definition**: The creation of the sandbox requires the definition of the sandbox structure and configuration of the individual virtual machines. The definition in the context of KYPO is the directory named after sandbox definition which contains: 
    * <ins>***Topology Definition***</ins>: The file with the sandbox structure definition (hosts, routers, networks, etc.). For more detailed information about the topology definition, check the page [Toplogy Definition](/sandboxes/sandbox-topology/topology-definition). Created sandbox inside the cloud is called KYPO [Topology Instance](/sandboxes/sandbox-topology/topology-instance).
    * <ins>***User Ansible***</ins>: It is used to customize Topology Instances, e.g., set up environment, create users, install packages, etc. User Ansible must specify the way how to connect to instances, e.g., user name and SSH key. The Ansible tool is used to perform these actions. For more detailed information about the topology definition, check the page [User Ansible](/sandboxes/user-ansible).

    Sandbox definitions are created by so-called **sandbox designers** and they must be stored as a GIT repository so it can be used inside the KYPO portal. GIT repository also must be accessible by the KYPO platform. For more detailed information about the topology definition, check the page [Sandbox Definition](/sandboxes/sandbox-definition).

* **Pool**: Before creating sandboxes, it is essential to create in system so-called pools. Pools are groups of sandboxes that are created based on the same sandbox definition. A definition is specified before creating the pool by **sandbox organizer**. After creating the pool, it is possible to start with the allocation of the sandboxes, which is divided into three phases:
    1. <ins>***Sandbox Allocation***</ins>: The creation of sandbox (virtual machines) inside the cloud. 
    2. <ins>***Ansible Networking***</ins>: Networking of the virtual machines and distribution of user keys to machines. The phase is executed automatically and is not the responsibility of the user. 
    3. <ins>***User Ansible***</ins>: Customization of virtual machines already above-mentioned.

### Trainings 
In the KYPO environment, the following terminology is associated with the trainings: 

* **Training Definition**: The progress of the whole exercise must be somehow described. For this purpose, users called **training designers** create *training definitions*. Training definition includes information about the title, notes for instructors, learning outcomes, and levels that consist of. There are three types of levels: 
    1. <ins>***Info Level***</ins>: Contains information for the player (welcome message or important information about the following levels).
    2. <ins>***Game Level***</ins>: In the level, the user has to solve a predefined assignment. By solving the assignment, the player acquires a secret flag, and after submitting the flag, they can continue to the next level of the training. 
    3. <ins>***Assessment Level***</ins>: Can be either a test or a questionnaire, and it serves to test usersâ€™ knowledge or gets feedback from users. The assessment can contain one of the following types of question: 
        * *MCQ (Multiple choice question)*: Players are asked to select one or multiple answers from the choices offered as a list.
        * *EMI (Extended matching items)*: Players are asked to pair items from row and column that are semantically related. 
        * *FFQ (Freeform question)*: Players are asked to type the answer to the submit field.

* **Training Instance**: A time-limited period in which players can participate in training which is specified by the assigned training definition. The whole progress of training instance is managed by **training organizers (instructors)** who can monitor events made by players that are displayed in various graphs and tables. Each training instance has an assigned *pool*. 

* **Training Run**: Represents a single run of the training of the particular player. This player is called a **trainee**. The run is accessed based on the access token obtained from the training instance instructor. The player enters the access token to the particular field and if the token is valid, the training run starts (behind the sciences, a sandbox is assigned to that training run from the pool that is associated with the particular training instance).
