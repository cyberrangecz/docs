# CyberRangeCZ Platform

CyberRangeCZ Platform is a fork of the KYPO Cyber Range Platform (KYPO CRP), a registered trademark of Masaryk University.  The original KYPO CRP was developed by Masaryk University starting in 2013, representing years of experience in cyber ranges for education, cyber defense exercises, and training.  CyberRangeCZ Platform builds upon this foundation.

CyberRangeCZ Platform, is built using modern approaches like containers, infrastructure as code, microservices, and open-source software, including the OpenStack and AWS cloud provider technology.  The emphasis on repeatability, scalability, automation, and interoperability minimizes human tasks and makes cyber trainings affordable.

CyberRangeCZ Platform maintains the open approach to content and architecture pioneered by KYPO CRP, encouraging a community of trainers in creation and sharing of training building blocks.  Virtual machines, networks, and trainings are defined in human-readable data-serialization languages (JSON and YAML) using open-source tools like Packer for building virtual machine images and Ansible for describing machine content.

The CyberRangeCZ Platform sources are currently hosted at [https://github.com/cyberrangecz](https://github.com/cyberrangecz). The original KYPO CRP sources are hosted at [https://gitlab.ics.muni.cz/muni-kypo-crp](https://gitlab.ics.muni.cz/muni-kypo-crp).
