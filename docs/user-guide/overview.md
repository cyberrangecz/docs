 1. [Training agenda](./training-agenda/training-agenda-overview.md) with main focus on creation and organization of trainings.
 2. [Sandbox agenda](./sandbox-agenda/sandbox-agenda-overview.md) that specifies guide lines for sandbox creation and realization. 
 3. [User agenda](./user-and-group-agenda/user-and-group-agenda-overview.md) that deals with the administration of users and their access to the specific parts of the KYPO portal based on user access roles.
