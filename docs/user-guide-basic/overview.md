# Overview

The objective of the **User Guide (Basic)** is to provide basic guidelines to the users of the CyberRangeCZ Platform Portal. CyberRangeCZ Platform Portal is a graphical user interface that mediates access to the platform for the end-users by providing them with interactive visualization tools. In particular, the portal is designed to cover the microservices that manage the different areas of the CyberRangeCZ Platform and provide core functionalities.

The portal is divided into three **CyberRangeCZ Platform agendas**:

1. **[Sandboxes agenda](sandbox-agenda/sandbox-agenda-overview.md)** specifies guidelines for sandbox creation and realization.
2. **[Trainings agenda](training-agenda/training-agenda-overview.md)** with main focus on creation and organization of trainings.
3. **[Administration agenda](administration-agenda/administration-agenda-overview.md)** deals with the administration of users and their access to the specific parts of the CyberRangeCZ Platform Portal based on user access roles.

Then the User Guide (Basic) section then serves as a manual on how to operate all of the functions that these agendas offer.

## User Roles
