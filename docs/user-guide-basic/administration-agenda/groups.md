This page is used to list all groups created in the CyberRangeCZ Platform. Groups are essential to the user-access, as the access roles are not assigned to specific users but groups. The user acquires access to the CyberRangeCZ Platform portal agendas based on the roles of the groups they belong to. Each group also has a separate detail page containing additional information about it. This page can be accessed upon clicking on the group's name.

!!! note
    Create Group and Edit Group pages are the same but the Edit Group page has some fields pre-filled.

During the creation of a group, the second and third panels are disabled. To make them accessible, the administrator must fill the required fields in the first panel and either click on:

1. ![Create button](/img/buttons/create-button.png){: .inline-button } that will create the new group and redirect the administrator back to the **Group Overview**.
2. ![Create and continue button](/img/buttons/create-and-continue-button.png){: .inline-button } that will stay on the page and allow the administrator to edit **members** and **roles** of the group.

### 1. Create/Edit Group
Here, the administrator is required to fill up all the necessary fields before creating a new group. The `Expiration Date` field is optional and is useful in the cases when the administrator will create a group of instructors, e.g., for a particular semester. After filling up fields, click on the ![Create button](/img/buttons/create-button.png){: .inline-button } button to save the group. Then panels **Edit members** and **Edit roles** will be rolled down.

### 2. Edit Members
Here, the administrator can add users individually or import all users from the group. The part **Add users** provides an easy way to search for users whose administrator wants to add to the group. Administrators can also add all users from the specific group in the part **Import users**. Click on the ![Add button](/img/buttons/add-button.png){: .inline-button } button to add selected users to the group. All users will be added to the group and will be present in the list in the part **Members of group**. A user or multiple users can be removed via the common way mentioned before.
