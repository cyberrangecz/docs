## Login

Enter a URL of the CyberRangeCZ Platform to your web browser to navigate to the CyberRangeCZ Platform Portal web page. Log in using one of the available OIDC providers. If you are not using Keycloak OIDC provider, **you must give access to your name**. If you have to use a Keycloak OIDC provider **(Keycloak issuer)**, which is a part of the CyberRangeCZ Platform, the administrator must provide credentials (username and password) to you.
