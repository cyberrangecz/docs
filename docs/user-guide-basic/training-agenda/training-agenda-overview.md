# Overview

!!! warning
    Adaptivity is considered an experimental feature and is not documented yet. Please use only documentation of linear trainings.

The purpose of the Training Agenda is to create and manage trainings that are only available to users with the role [instructor](../../../user-guide-advanced/users-and-groups/roles/#instructor). Another purpose of the agenda is accessing training runs which is available for all users with the role [trainee](../../../user-guide-advanced/users-and-groups/roles/#trainee). These activities are mapped onto the [Training Creation](../../../basic-concepts/typical-workflow-for-training/#training-creation) workflow. The training agenda is divided into three sections:

* **Training Definition** section is used to create and manage training definitions (the content of trainings). You can choose between the **[Linear Training Definition](training-definition/linear-training-definition.md)** and **[Adaptive Training Definition](training-definition/adaptive-training-definition.md)**
 
* **Training Instance** section is used to create and manage training instances (a time-limited period to participate in training). You can also choose between **[Linear Training Instance](training-instance/linear-training-instance.md)** and **[Adaptive Training Instance](training-instance/adaptive-training-instance.md)**. 

* **Training Run** section is used to access new training runs and for the overview of already accessed training runs and their results. The runs may differ on the type training. See **[Linear Training Run](training-run/linear-training-run.md)** and **[Adaptive Training Run](training-run/adaptive-training-run.md)**
