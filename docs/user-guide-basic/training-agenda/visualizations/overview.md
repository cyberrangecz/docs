# Overview

The visualizations serve for a better grasp of the data collected during the training sessions. They can be divided into two types according to the type of the training:

1. **[Visualizations for *linear* training](../visualizations-for-linear/)** 
2. **[Visualizations for *adaptive* training](../visualizations-for-adaptive/)**

When considering the main user roles related to the usage of the visualizations, the *linear* games can be further divided as:

1. **[Visualizations for *instructors*](../visualizations-for-linear/#for-instructors)** are available either for viewing the ongoing training instances or their summary results.
2. **[Visualizations for *trainees*](../visualizations-for-linear/#for-trainees)** can be viewed by the trainees after they finish their training runs.

!!! note
    See the page [Roles](../../../../user-guide-advanced/users-and-groups/roles/) for more specific explanation of the roles and their privileges.
