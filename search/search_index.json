We also do not need any regular expressions to parse the message events.</p> <p>The overall architecture is shown in the following figure: </p> <p>In this architecture, the logs are forwarded from hosts or any other sandbox components to MAN. This is done using Rsyslog implementation that defines the template representing the RFC5424 structure, including Structured Data for meta-data fields as pool_id, sandbox_id, etc. In the case of local deployment, the logs from sandboxes are stored on MAN. In the case of server deployment, the logs are further redirected to the central logging server using Syslog-ng without any modification. At the CyberRangeCZ Platform central logging server, the logs are parsed based on the programname, and further sent to the particular Logstash pipeline (based on the programname). In the particular Logstash pipeline, the data are transformed into the final form and further sent to Elasticsearch instance under specific index, e.g., crczp.logs.console.${programname}.pool=XYZ.sandbox=XYZ where ${programname} is, e.g., in the case of bash commands bash.command (the Elasticsearch index have to be in lowercase).</p>"},{"location":"extras/logging/how-to-use-it/","title":"How to Use It","text":""},{"location":"extras/logging/how-to-use-it/#enable-command-logging-currently-supported-for-debian-based-images","title":"Enable command logging (Currently supported for Debian-based images)","text":"<p>Command logging was originally enabled on host VMs by using three Ansible roles.

For that reason, we had used the Implicit code grant in our OIDC settings tutorial.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Currently, the best practice for security reasons in user-agent applications is to use the Authorization code grant + PKCE. This is perfectly described in the following RFC 7636.</p>"},{"location":"reference/adaptive-smart-assistant-swagger-open-api/","title":"Adaptive Smart Assistant Service","text":""},{"location":"reference/adaptive-training-swagger-open-api/","title":"Adaptive Training Service","text":""},{"location":"reference/answers-storage-swagger-open-api/","title":"Answers Storage","text":""},{"location":"reference/elasticsearch-service-swagger-open-api/","title":"Elasticsearch Service","text":""},{"location":"reference/mitre-technique-service-swagger-open-api/","title":"Mitre Technique Service","text":""},{"location":"reference/sandbox-service-swagger-open-api/","title":"Sandbox Service","text":""},{"location":"reference/tables-of-permissions/","title":"Tables of Permissions","text":"<p>The following tables display the actions that can perform the users with the specified role.

For example, the pre-training questions A is assigned to the particular phases, so we know what questions are related to what phase. Furthermore, after the pre-training question, the first training phase is the access phase, which describes how to connect to the sandbox. It is crucial that all the students are connected to the virtual environment before the training begins.

The questions asked in the pre-training questionnaire are grouped into linked relations to specific training phases. Each question can be assigned into several relations since they can be relevant to more phases. For each training phase, the essential ratio of knowledge is set to determine whether the student\u2019s theoretical knowledge or self-reported phase of skills is sufficient or not. The questionnaire can contain one of the following types of questions:<ul> <li>Multiple choice question (MCQ): Trainees are asked to select one or multiple answers from the choices offered as a list.</li> <li>Free form question (FFQ): Trainees are asked to type the answer to the submit field.

To compute the most suitable task for the trainee, the Decision Matrix is defined in each phase. The matrix allows the instructor to set up the weights of the several aspects considered during the computation. The higher the computed value is, the more difficult task is chosen. The used aspects are:<ul> <li>Pre-training Questionnaire - correctly answered a group of questions related to the phase in the adaptive questionnaire phase.</li> <li>Keyword Used - the number of used expected key commands in the command line within the given task.</li> <li>Completed in Time - the trainee completes the task in the predefined time.</li> <li>Solution Displayed - the trainee has revealed the solution.</li> <li>Submitted Answers - the number of the submitted incorrect answers.

Each of these methods executes an algorithm to detect suspicious activities on logs and data, that was provided by the trainees up to this point in time. Cheating detections can be executed both while the training is still running and after the training was finished. You can execute multiple cheating detections with different methods and parameters, however, it is not advised to execute them at the same time in trainings with a lot of participants (100+) as it may negatively affect performance.</p> <p>It is worth noting, that these detection methods do not irrefutably incriminate trainees of cheating. Some of the detection methods can also supplement each other, so it\u2019s worth using all the detection methods, when they are sensible in the context.</p> <p>So far the cheating detection supports these methods:</p> Answer Similarity <p>Occurs when a trainee submits an answer for a level that was incorrect, but was a correct answer for another trainee (who most likely shared his answer). This detection method is relevant for APG trainings, where answers for trainees are randomly generated.</p> Location Similarity <p>Occurs when two or more trainees submit the answer to a level from the same domain. This detection is relevant for trainings where all participants are expected to have different domains (excludes trainings where all trainees are connected to CyberRangeCZ Platform from the same IP network).</p> Time Proximity <p>Occurs when two or more trainees submit a correct answer for a level in a short time window. This time window can be specified in a label \u2018proximity threshold\u2019 in seconds, with default value being two minutes. This detection is relevant for trainings that span a longer time period (for example two weeks), but is irrelevant for a short term training (one hour exam).</p> Minimal Solve Time <p>Occurs when a trainee solves a level in a shorter time that is the specified minimal possible solve time for the level. For this detection to be relevant, minimal solving time must be reasonably specified when creating a level in training definition. Too much time will result in many false negatives while too little time in false positives. This detection might not prove someone cheated right away, but can be a great supplement for all the detection methods described above.</p> No Commands <p>Occurs when a trainee solves a level without using any commands in a provided console, when the level specifically required it. The requirement for using commands is specified in the box \u2018are_commands_required\u2019 when creating a level in training definition.</p> Forbidden Commands <p>Occures when a trainee submits a command that was specified as \u2018forbidden\u2019 by the instructor.
